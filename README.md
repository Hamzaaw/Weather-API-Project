## European Weather Forecast Website

Overview
This project involves building a website that provides a 7-day weather forecast for major European cities. The project aims to support a European travel agency in increasing bookings by offering visitors real-time weather information.

The website is built using HTML, JavaScript, and JSON to request, process, and present weather data.
It utilizes the 7Timer API, a free and accessible weather forecast service that does not require API keys.



HTML: Forms the structure and content of the webpage.

JavaScript: Used to interact with the 7Timer API and handle data retrieval.

CSS & Bootstrap: Enhances the visual styling and layout of the webpage.

Using Python's http.server (if Python is installed):
Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory of your project.

Run the following command:

bash
Copy code
python -m http.server
(Use python3 instead of python if you're on macOS or Linux).

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8000.
