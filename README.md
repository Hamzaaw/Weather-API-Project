# European Weather Forecast Website

## Overview
This project involves building a website that provides a 7-day weather forecast for major European cities. The project aims to support a European travel agency in increasing bookings by offering visitors real-time weather information.

The website is built using HTML, JavaScript, and JSON to request, process, and present weather data. It utilizes the 7Timer API, a free and accessible weather forecast service that does not require API keys.

### Technologies Used
- HTML: Forms the structure and content of the webpage.
- JavaScript: Used to interact with the 7Timer API and handle data retrieval.
- CSS & Bootstrap: Enhances the visual styling and layout of the webpage.

## Getting Started
To explore this project and its functionalities, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hamzaaw/Weather-API-Project


2. Open the index.html file in your  web browser to access the weather forecast webpage.

If you encounter a CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policy error, you can resolve it by serving your files using a local server. Here's how to do it based on your preferred tool:

Using Python's http.server (if Python is installed):
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory of your project.
3. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   python -m http.server

(Use python3 instead of python if you're on macOS or Linux).

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8000.
